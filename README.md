### Logs a detailed history of executed terminal commands for easier access.


## Features!
Provides data and features which terminals doesn't provide. Like:

- Interactive search.
- Save commands for future and easier access.
- Opens Terminal and executes command in the directory with just one click.
- Shows the Time and Directory where a particular command has been executed.
- Shows the count of every executed command.

## Why?

- Because `grep`ing `history` wastes a lot of time while coding. 

- We need to execute the command again if there is any spelling error or syntax error.

- We need to execute it multiple times if we don't remember the command we are searching for.

- The command should be precisly selected with a mouse which is sometimes frustrating.
